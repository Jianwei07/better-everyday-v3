## Brain Potential & Visualization

- Visualization can increase muscle mass. A study found weightlifters who visualized lifting (no physical exercise) for 2 weeks saw a **13% increase in muscle mass**.
- The brain is highly adaptable; we underestimate our potential for mental growth.

## Stress: Physiology, Contagion, and Effects

- **Cortisol** is the main stress hormone. Chronic high cortisol causes **inflammation**, especially in the vascular system, and leads to **belly fat** that is hard to lose.
- **Stress leaks:** Cortisol is released in sweat, can be absorbed by others’ skin, and impacts people around you (stress is physiologically contagious).
- Leadership stress has a “leaking down” effect: stressed leaders raise stress in teams.

---

## Social & Emotional Contagion

- People tend to synchronize stress, mood, and even biological cycles (e.g., menstrual cycles) when in close proximity.
- Social contagion: If someone in your social circle divorces or becomes obese, you are statistically more likely to as well.

## Brain-Body Connection & Executive Performance

- Many high performers neglect physical health, underestimating how essential sleep, hydration, movement, and nutrition are for brain function.
- Mental and emotional stress can cause physical illness (heart attacks among executives with no classic risk factors).

---

## Sleep & Brain Health

- Sleep is vital for:
  - Laying down memories
  - Emotional processing
  - Physical and neurological regeneration
- The **glymphatic system** cleans toxins (like amyloid plaques) from the brain during 7–8 hours of sleep—critical for preventing dementia (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s).

---

## Building Resilience

- **Resilience** is both physiological (measured via HRV) and psychological.
- Skin reflects stress (“psychological boundary” as well as physical). Chronic stress can worsen skin conditions.

---

## Ways to Reduce Stress

1. **Exercise** – Aerobic exercise helps sweat out cortisol.
2. **Journaling/Speaking** – Writing or voicing thoughts helps process and release stress.
3. **Social support** – Deep, positive relationships are protective.

---

## Oxytocin & Bonding

- Eye contact (especially right-eye to left-eye) and physical touch increase **oxytocin** and trust.
- Co-sleeping and physical affection increase emotional resilience and bonding.
- Laughter and shared struggle boost oxytocin.

---

## Neuroplasticity & Habit Change

- The brain changes and grows until about **age 25**, but you can still improve brain function through intense learning or new challenges after that.
- Steps for behavior change:
  1. **Awareness** – Recognize the pattern.
  2. **Focused Attention** – Reflect on triggers and consequences.
  3. **Deliberate Practice** – Practice new behaviors repeatedly.
  4. **Accountability** – Use external or social support to maintain change.

---

## Intuition

- Intuition is “embodied wisdom”—lessons stored in the nervous system, not always conscious.
- Women may be more attuned to intuition, but both genders can develop it.

---

## Generational Trauma & Epigenetics

- Trauma and stress can be inherited through both psychology (generational trauma) and gene expression (epigenetics).
- Stress during pregnancy can impact a baby’s future resilience and anxiety.

---

## Nature, Purpose, and Creativity

- Spending time in nature, pursuing creative activities, and having a purpose that goes beyond yourself are essential for wellbeing and longevity.
- Aesthetics, beauty, and nature signal safety to the brain (“If I have time to enjoy beauty, I am safe”).

---

## Relationships & Tribe

- Carefully choosing who is in your “tribe” affects your mindset, health, and neuroplasticity.
- Positive, supportive, and growth-oriented relationships are crucial for mental health.

---

## Grief, Trauma, and Healing

- Grief and trauma require full emotional processing to heal—avoidance can prolong suffering.
- Neuroplasticity offers hope for change, even after deep trauma, though some patterns may persist.

---

# Practical Takeaways

- **Prioritize sleep, exercise, hydration, and social connection for brain health.**
- **Manage stress proactively to avoid physical and psychological consequences.**
- **Pursue novelty, creativity, and purpose to maintain brain flexibility.**
- **Bonding, touch, and laughter are critical for resilience.**
- **Be mindful of social contagion—surround yourself with positive influences.**
- **Intentionally process grief and trauma for true healing.**
